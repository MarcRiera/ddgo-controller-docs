## Adapters and hacks

Besides the official compatibility, it is possible to use unofficial adapters, tools and hacks to use controllers with games which is unsupported officially.

### PlayStation 2 cheat codes for PlayStation 1 controllers

While **Densha de GO! 3** and **Densha de GO! Shinkansen** officially support the original (non-USB) PlayStation 1 controllers, **Densha de GO! Ryojouhen**, **Densha de GO! Professional 2** and **Densha de GO! Final** are only compatible with USB controllers. Via cheat codes, it is possible to use the original PlayStation 1 controllers on real hardware, either with retail discs or via OPL.

The codes emulate a Type 2 controller. You will need to connect the controller as follows:

- Port 1: Dualshock or Dualshock 2 (D-pad, needed for menus)
- Port 2: PlayStation 1 controller (handles and buttons, **SELECT** is mapped to **D**)

Each game requires an specific cheat code:

- [Densha de GO! Professional 2](controller-cheat_pro2.txt)
- [Densha de GO! Professional 2 (Taito Best)](controller-cheat_pro2best.txt)

For retail discs, the codes can be loaded with [ps2rd](https://github.com/mlafeldt/ps2rd) or [Cheat Device](https://github.com/root670/CheatDevicePS2). If you are using OPL, it already includes ps2rd and you just need to copy the codes and enable cheats.
