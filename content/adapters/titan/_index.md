[ConsoleTuner](https://www.consoletuner.com) sells the Titan One and Titan Two USB devices. They support scripts to remap buttons or change the behaviour of a controller entirely. There are many repositories available with scripts to make a *Densha de GO!* controller behave like a different one:

- [tylau0/DenGo](https://github.com/tylau0/DenGo)
- [arnauos/densha-de-go](https://github.com/arnauos/densha-de-go)
- [mikaeltarquin/densha-de-go](https://github.com/mikaeltarquin/densha-de-go)
- [thmalex/DenshaDeGoPS1toPS4](https://github.com/thmalex/DenshaDeGoPS1toPS4)
- [MarcRiera/ddgo-scripts](https://github.com/MarcRiera/ddgo-scripts)

Before using a script, check whether it was designed for the Titan One or the Titan Two. They share the same extension (.GPC) but are different. The Titan Two is backwards compatible with many Titan One scripts, but not viceversa.
