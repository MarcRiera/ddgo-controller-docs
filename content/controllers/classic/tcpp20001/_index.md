The controller follows the same standard [internal operation](../tech) as other classic controllers. As the controller only has one handle, brake and power cannot be set separately. In addition, only the first and fourth unmarked positions are available.

To allow PlayStation software to distinguish the controller from a standard controller, **UP** and **DOWN** on the D-pad are pressed permanently. This combination is impossible on an unmodified digital gamepad or Dualshock.
