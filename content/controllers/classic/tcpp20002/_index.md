The controller follows the same standard [internal operation](../tech) as other classic controllers. In addition, only the first and fourth unmarked positions are available.

To allow PlayStation software to distinguish the controller from a standard controller, **UP** and **DOWN** on the D-pad are pressed permanently. This combination is impossible on an unmodified digital gamepad or Dualshock.
