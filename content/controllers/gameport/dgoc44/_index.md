{{% controller-page "dgoc44" %}}

This is the original controller for the Microsoft Windows releases. This controller has two handles (5 power notches and 8+emergency brake notches) and 3 buttons (A, B, C).

The buttons and handles are mapped to game port buttons and axes, respectively, as follows:

| Game port   | Controller |
|-------------|------------|
| B1          | B          |
| B2          | A          |
| B3          | *Unused*   |
| B4          | C          |
| X1          | Brake      |
| Y1          | Power      |
| X2          | *Unused*   |
| Y2          | *Unused*   |

The controller needs to be calibrated before it can be used.
