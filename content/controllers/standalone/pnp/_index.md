This controller is different from traditional controllers in the sense that it contains the game (an improved version of *Densha de GO! Final*) and does not connect to a PC or console. Externally, it looks similar to a TCPP-20009, except it does not include a pedal connection. Internally, it contains an ARM board running Linux. It requires a micro USB cable for power and a HDMI cable for video output.

The micro USB port supports USB OTG with a powered adapter and is used by Taito to install software updates.

## Mods

There are several unofficial mods available to improve or add functionality to the console:
