This controller is a self-contained console with a modified version of *Densha de GO! Final*. Externally, it looks similar to a TCPP-20009, except it does not include a pedal connection. It requires a micro USB cable for power and a HDMI cable for video output.

Internally, it contains an ARM board running a Linux distro. The micro USB port supports USB OTG with a powered adapter and is used by Taito to install software updates.

## Mods

There are several unofficial mods available to improve or add functionality to the console:
