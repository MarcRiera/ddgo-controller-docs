{{% controller-page "dgc255" %}}

This controller has one handle (5 power notches and 8+emergency brake notches), a D-Pad and 6 buttons (Select, Start, A, B, C, D).

Internally, it is a HID-compliant joystick with two axes, 6 buttons and a PoV hat switch (the handle positions are reported via axes).

Besides the PoV hat switch, it reports the same data as a DGOC-44U controller. The games check if the controller has a PoV hat switch to distinguish between a DGC-255 and a DGOC-44U.
