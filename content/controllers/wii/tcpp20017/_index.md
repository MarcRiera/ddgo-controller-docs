This controller is similar externally to the PlayStation 2 version of the Shinkansen controller. However, the screen has been replaced by a sticker and there is no pedal, so the only functioning parts are the handles, the buttons and the door lamp. In addition, instead of USB, it connects to a Wiimote using its extension port, like other accessories made for the console. No details are available regarding internal functioning.
